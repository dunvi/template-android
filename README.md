## First Time Configuration (without imported settings)

1. Launch AndroidStudio.
1. In the Android Studio Setup Wizard, click "Cancel" and confirm.
1. Click "More Actions".
1. Click "SDK Manager".
1. The "Android SDK Location" should be empty. Click "Edit".
1. Ensure all checkboxes possible are unchecked (some may not allow it).
1. Ensure the "Android SDK Location" points to the local `asdk` folder.
1. Click through the wizard to complete it. The "Android SDK Location" should now show the expected local `asdk` folder.
1. Click OK. You should now be able to open a new or existing project.

## Troubleshooting

* To get rid of all AndroidStudio settings, delete `~/.config/Google/AndroidStudio*`
